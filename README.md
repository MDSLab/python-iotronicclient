# python-iotronicclient
Python client library for the IoTronic API

In order to correctly run this client on your machine you need to have some python packages already installed which are:
* python-oslo-utils
* python-oslo-i18n
* python-keystoneauth1

If any of them is not present you can use ```pip``` (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) or OS-depending software package managers (e.g.: apt-get, dpkg, yum, etc...) to install them.

Once you have the previous packages installed you have to clone the git repository and then launch: ```sudo ./build.sh```
